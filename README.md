## Description üìÑ

This is the first phase of a four-phase project to create a basic clone of the AirBnB web app. In this first phase, a basic console was created using the Cmd Python module to manage the objects of the whole project, being able to implement the methods create, show, update, all, and destroy to the existing classes and subclasses.

## Environment üíª

The console was developed in Ubuntu 14.04LTS using python3 (version 3.10.8).

## Further Information üìë

## Requirements üìù

Knowledge in python3, how to use a command line interpreter, a computer with Ubuntu 20.04, python3, and pep8 style corrector.
